# snowball
I coded the game in Java with java.swing, and I illustrated the images in Photoshop.

The objective of the game is to avoid being hit by incoming snowballs. The game is on a 10x10 grid, and the player can move around with arrow keys. When a snowball is about to hit a tile, a shadow appears on the tile, and after two seconds the snowball makes impact. The game ends when the player gets hit by a snowball.
